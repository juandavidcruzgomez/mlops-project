       " A5327 Eligibility Criteria (Cohort 1 and Cohort 2) Step 1 inclusion criteria for both cohorts (Cohort 1 and Cohort 2) - HIV-1 infection, documented by any licensed rapid HIV test or HIV enzyme or chemiluminescence immunoassay (E/CIA) test kit at any time prior to study entry and confirmed by a licensed Western blot or a second antibody test by a method other than the initial rapid HIV and/or E/CIA, or by HIV-1 p24 antigen, or plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load. [NOTE: The term \\licensed\\\" refers to a FDA-approved kit, which is required for all IND studies.] WHO (World Health Organization) and CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) guidelines mandate that confirmation of the initial test result must use a test that is different from the one used for the initial assessment. A reactive initial rapid test should be confirmed by either another type of rapid assay or an E/CIA that is based on a different antigen preparation and/or different test principle (e.g., indirect versus competitive), or a Western blot or a plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load. - A documented confirmation of acute HCV infection within 6 months prior to A5327 entry or HCV reinfection as described below: 1. Acute HCV infection was defined as meeting one of the following criteria and exclusion of other causes of acute hepatitis: - New (<24 weeks prior to initial A5327 entry) ALT elevation to ≥5X upper limit of normal (ULN) OR >250 U/L in patients with documented normal ALT in the preceding 12 months or ≥10X ULN OR >500 U/L in patients with abnormal or no measured ALT baseline in the preceding 12 months with detectable HCV RNA excluding those with any prior positive anti-HCV. OR - Detectable HCV RNA with prior negative anti-HCV Ab or undetectable HCV RNA within the preceding 6 months. 2. Acute HCV reinfection was defined by documentation of clearance of prior infection (as evidenced by positive anti-HCV Ab) either spontaneously or after treatment with two negative HCV RNA a minimum of 6 months apart AND meeting one of the following criteria in addition to exclusion of other causes of acute hepatitis: - New (<24 weeks prior to initial A5327 entry) ALT elevation to ≥5X ULN OR >250 U/L in patients with documented normal ALT in the preceding 12 months or ≥10X ULN OR >500 U/L in patients with abnormal or no measured ALT baseline in the preceding 12 months with detectable HCV RNA. OR - Positive HCV RNA with prior negative HCV RNA within the preceding 6 months. - HCV RNA confirmed to be detectable >12 weeks after first laboratory evidence of acute HCV and still within the <24 week from first laboratory evidence of acute HCV infection window. First laboratory evidence of infection was defined as date of first elevated liver enzymes or date of first serologic evidence of HCV seroconversion and/or viremia (whichever occurs first). [NOTE: If the screening visit occurred less than 12 weeks from the first laboratory evidence of infection, then the participant was required a pre-entry study visit to confirm detectable HCV RNA at least 12 weeks from the first laboratory evidence of infection had passed. It was optimal for this pre-entry visit to occur as close as possible to 12 weeks from first laboratory evidence to ensure timely treatment.

       " DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: - Histologically documented adenocarcinoma of the prostate - Progressive, systemic (metastatic) disease despite castrate levels of testosterone due to orchiectomy or luteinizing-hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist, meeting 1 of the following criteria: - Measurable disease, defined as any lesion that can be accurately measured in at least 1 dimension ≥ 2 cm by conventional techniques or ≥ 1 cm by spiral CT scan or MRI - Nonmeasurable disease with PSA ≥ 5 ng/mL - Bone lesions - Pleural or pericardial effusions, ascites - CNS lesions, leptomeningeal disease - Irradiated lesions, unless progression documented after radiotherapy - No PSA ≥ 5 ng/mL as only evidence of disease - PSA evidence for progressive prostate cancer consists of a PSA level ≥ 5 ng/mL that has risen on ≥ 2 successive occasions, ≥ 2 weeks apart - Castrate levels of testosterone (< 50 ng/dL) must be maintained - If no prior orchiectomy, patients must remain on testicular androgen suppression (e.g., with an LHRH analogue) - Patients receiving an antiandrogen as part of primary androgen ablation must demonstrate disease progression after discontinuation of antiandrogen - Disease progression after antiandrogen withdrawal is defined as 2 consecutive rising PSA values, obtained at least 2 weeks apart, or documented osseous or soft tissue progression - For patients receiving flutamide or megestrol acetate, at least 1 of the PSA values must be obtained 4 weeks or more after flutamide/megestrol acetate discontinuation - For patients receiving bicalutamide or nilutamide, at least 1 of the PSA values must be obtained 6 weeks or more after antiandrogen discontinuation - If improvement after antiandrogen withdrawal is noted, disease progression must be established - No pleural effusion or ascites that causes respiratory compromise ( ≥ grade 2 dyspnea) - No history of CNS disease, including primary brain tumor, seizures, or carcinomatous meningitis PATIENT

Subjects who have completed local therapy and have discontinued the use of steroids for this indication at least 4 weeks prior to commencing treatment and in whom stability has been proven by at least 2 CT or MRI scans obtained at least 4 weeks apart are eligible for Phase 1b only. Phase 2 only: Subjects with CNS (e.g., brain or leptomeningeal) metastasis are excluded. - Phase 2 only: More than one prior VEGF-targeted treatment for unresectable advanced or metastatic RCC.

Phase 2 only: Prior exposure to lenvatinib or mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor. - Subjects should not have received any anticancer treatment within 21 days or any investigational agent within 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug and should have recovered from any toxicity related to previous anticancer treatment.
